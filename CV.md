# Kyle Outlaw | CV


## Hello! 
I'm Kyle, a UX/UI leader based out of New York. My main areas of focus have been on human-centered design, rapid prototyping, user research and testing, data-driven design, and mentoring. These days I've been most interested in the decentralized web, and advances in AI and machine learning — as well as the implications for both the tools we use and the experiences that we build for customers.

## About me
I have 20+ years in digital design, and I have worked for agencies including Publicis Sapient, Razorfish, R/GA, and helped found a startup that was sold for $44 million. Brands I've worked with include Mercedes-Benz, Sprinter, smart car, Google, Motorola, UNIQLO, Unilever, Nike, Converse, Ralph Lauren, Victoria's Secret, Tory Burch, Citi, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, and several others. I have been a speaker and conducted workshops at SXSW, IXDA, the User Experience Professionals Association, the Internet Freedom Festival, and several other industry events. I am a graduate of NYU's Interactive Telecommunication Program. 

Before starting my design career I taught English in Japan for two and a half years and travelled around Asia with my mountain bike. When not working I like to travel, run, meditate, read, sketch, play bass guitar, create analog and digital art, listen to music, and eat vegan food.
